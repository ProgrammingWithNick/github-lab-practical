GitHub collaboration enables multiple developers to work on the same 
project simultaneously by using distributed version control to track 
changes and merge code via branches and pull requests. Team members 
can propose changes, review code, and resolve conflicts, facilitating 
seamless teamwork and high-quality code integration.
